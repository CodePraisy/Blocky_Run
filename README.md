# Blocky_Run-v0.0.0.3

## Update

- Added a reset button to the pause menu.
- Added the use of arrow keys to control character.
- Added a reset button at the end of the game to reset progress.
- Added version tag to menu and pause menu

This update was just some more bug fixes and stuff like that.

(Expect the next update to be big, since i've just finished with all the main bugs I've wanted to fix.)


### How to install the game

- click on the green "Code" button and then click "Download ZIP"
- right click the downloaded file and click "Extract"
- Once it's finished, go to the folder it just made and click the file called "Blocky Run!"
- Then play!

### How the new version system works

The version system goes like this:

the first number is meant for when the game releases or if theres a second version, right now it's zero because I havent technacclly released the game yet.

The second number is big updates, for example, an addition of more then 5 levels, or other big things.

The third number is for small things like new UI pages and things of that nature.

The last number is for bug fixes and very tiny UI or game mechanic changes.

## Other information

This is the github version of Blocky Run! This is pretty much where all the beta versions of Blocky Run will go until I release the full version on steam.

Please note that this is the beta version and not the full game so expect bugs. Feel free to report any bugs or such to me or in the "Discussions" Section on github!
