# Blocky_Run-v0.0.0.3

This is the github version of Blocky Run! This is pretty much where all the beta versions of Blocky Run will go until I release the full version on steam.

To download the game, click on the green "Code" button and then click "Download ZIP". Once you've done that, right click the downloaded file and click "Extract". Once it's finished, go to the folder it just made and click the file called "Blocky Run!". Then the game should start running! 

The version system goes like this:

the first number is meant for when the game releases or if theres a second version, right now it's zero because I havent technacclly released the game yet.

The second number is big updates, for example, an addition of more then 5 levels, or other big things.

The third number is for small things like new UI pages and things of that nature.

The last number is for bug fixes and very tiny UI or game mechanic changes.

Please note that this is the beta version and not the full game so expect bugs. Feel free to report any bugs or such to me or in the "Discussions" Section on github!
